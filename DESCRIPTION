Description: Software for computing a log-concave (maximum likelihood) estimator for independent and identically distributed data in any number of dimensions. For a detailed description of the method see Cule, Samworth and Stewart (2010, Journal of Royal Statistical Society Series B, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00753.x>).
