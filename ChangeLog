	cleaned up rlcd; fixed some plot things; added bunique,
	betaunique and removed dependence on 'akima' package.

	Corrected qhull options NOT to joggle input, as this is clearly
	ridiculous. Also removed an option that checks the triangulation
	at every stage, instead just doing it at the end.
	Removed dependence on 'geometry' package
	rlcd now uses a more sensible and faster methods of generating
	points on a simplex
